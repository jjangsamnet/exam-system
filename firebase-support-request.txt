Subject: Database Migration Failure - Permission Error in Firebase Data Connect

---

Hello Firebase Support Team,

I am experiencing an error when trying to migrate my Cloud SQL database schema for Firebase Data Connect.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Project ID: exam-system-28765
- Service ID: exam-system
- Cloud SQL Instance: exam-system-fdc
- Database: fdcdb
- Region: us-east4

PROBLEM:
When I try to run the database migration command, I receive a permission error:

Command executed:
  firebase dataconnect:sql:migrate --force

Error message:
  "Error: An unexpected error has occurred."

The error occurs during this step:
  "Granting firebaseowner role to myself kd12345@gmail.com..."

REQUIRED MIGRATION:
The following SQL statements need to be executed to make the database schema compatible with my Data Connect schema:

  ALTER TABLE "public"."user"
  ADD COLUMN "approval_status" character varying(20) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN "school_name" character varying(200) NULL;

ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. firebase dataconnect:sql:migrate - Failed with permission error
2. firebase dataconnect:sql:migrate --force - Failed with same error
3. firebase deploy --only dataconnect - Connection timeout
4. Direct SQL execution via Cloud SQL Studio - Error: "must be owner of table user"

QUESTION:
How can I properly migrate my database schema? Do I need additional IAM permissions for my account, or is there another way to execute this migration?

Additional Information:
- Firebase CLI version: (latest)
- The application is already deployed and running
- This is blocking the implementation of user approval system and school name features

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards
